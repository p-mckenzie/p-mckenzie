### Hello, world!

I'm Paige 👋 (she/her)

💻 I work as data scientist, using Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy) to creatively solve business problems with data!

⭐ Want to see some work samples?
* Visit my [blog](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/) to read about recent projects I've worked on
* check out my [example-projects](https://github.com/p-mckenzie/example-projects) repository to look at code

🌱 I’m currently working on learning more algorithms, strengthening my computer science fundamentals, and experimenting with UIs. 

🍩 Life outside of coding matters too! I enjoy making pastries, doing yoga, playing ukulele, and attending to my cat's every whim.
